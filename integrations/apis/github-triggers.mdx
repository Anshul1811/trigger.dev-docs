## onIssue

When an issue is created, modified or deleted. [GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/webhooks-and-events/webhooks/webhook-events-and-payloads#issues)

You can look at the `action` property of the payload to know what happened.

```ts
new Job(client, {
  id: "github-integration-on-issue",
  name: "GitHub Integration - On Issue",
  version: "0.1.0",
  trigger: githubApiKey.triggers.repo({
    event: events.onIssue,
    owner: "triggerdotdev",
    repo: "empty",
  }),
  run: async (payload, io, ctx) => {
    await io.logger.info("This is a simple log info message");
    return { payload, ctx };
  },
});
```
