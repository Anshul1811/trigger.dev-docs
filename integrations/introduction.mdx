## What is an integration?

An integration is a package you install that makes it easy to work with a specific API.

- Creates a connection to the API
- Provides a set of Tasks to work with the API
- Provides a set of Triggers to listen for events from the API
- Allows you to use the full underlying authenticated SDK client directly

## Integrations

| API                                 | Description                                                 | Webhooks | Tasks |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ----- |
| [GitHub](/integrations/apis/github) | Interact with GitHub                                        | ✔️       | ✔️    |
| [OpenAI](/integrations/apis/openai) | Generate text and images. Including longer than 30s prompts | N/A      | ✔️    |
| [Slack](/integrations/apis/slack)   | Send Slack messages                                         | TBD      | ✔️    |

## An example

This job sends Slack messages when a new GitHub issue is opened on the `triggerdotdev/trigger.dev` repo.

```ts
import { Github } from "@trigger.dev/github";
import { Slack } from "@trigger.dev/slack";

//create GitHub client using a token
const github = new Github({
  id: "github",
  token: process.env.GITHUB_TOKEN,
});

//create Slack client using OAuth
const slack = new Slack({
  id: "slack",
});

new Job(client, {
  id: "alert-on-new-github-issues",
  name: "Alert on new GitHub issues",
  version: "0.1.1",
  integrations: {
    //include the slack integration
    slack,
  },
  //use the github integration to listen for new issues
  trigger: github.triggers.repo({
    event: events.onIssueOpened,
    owner: "triggerdotdev",
    repo: "trigger.dev",
  }),
  run: async (payload, io, ctx) => {
    await io.wait("wait", 5); // wait for 5 seconds

    //send a message to slack
    const response = await io.slack.postMessage("Slack alert", {
      text: `New Issue opened: ${payload.issue.html_url}`,
      channel: "C04GWBTDQ7W",
    });

    return response;
  },
});
```

There are some things worth highlighting here:

- You can create integration clients using OAuth or API keys/tokens
- You can use the integration to listen for events from the API
- You can use the integration to make API calls inside the `run` function
