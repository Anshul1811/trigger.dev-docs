Note this is only relevant to you if you are [running the platform locally](/documentation/guides/self-hosting).

## How do I do it?

There are a few ways to do this, but we recommend using [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/). It's free and easy to use.

### 1. Download and setup ngrok

You can download ngrok [here](https://ngrok.com/download).

Follow the instructions on that page, but instead of port 80 use port 3010 (or whatever port you set the Trigger.dev platform to run on).

This will give you a public URL.

### 2. Use the public URL

Use the public URL that ngrok gave you for the `LOGIN_ORIGIN` and `API_ORIGIN` environment variables for the docker container.
