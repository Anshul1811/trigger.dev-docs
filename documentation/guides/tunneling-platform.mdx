Note this is only relevant to you if you are [running the platform locally](/documentation/guides/self-hosting).

## How do I do it?

There are a few ways to do this, but we recommend using [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/). It's free and easy to use.

### Start ngrok

<Snippet file="ngrok-steps.mdx" />

### 2. Use the forwarding URL

Use the forwarding URL that ngrok gave you for the `LOGIN_ORIGIN` and `API_ORIGIN` environment variables for the docker container.
