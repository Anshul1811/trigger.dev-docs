## What does this mean?

Instead of using the Trigger.dev Cloud service which we host for you, you can host the Trigger.dev platform yourself.

## Local development

When you're working on your web app, you can run Trigger.dev locally alongside your web app.

See our [GitHub docker project](https://github.com/triggerdotdev/docker) for instructions.

## Deployment

Coming soon
