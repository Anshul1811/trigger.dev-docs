## What does this mean?

Instead of using the [Trigger.dev Cloud](https://trigger.dev) service which we host for you, you can host the Trigger.dev platform yourself.

## Local development

When you're working on your web app, you can run Trigger.dev locally alongside your web app.

- See our [GitHub docker project](https://github.com/triggerdotdev/docker) for instructions.
- You will need to [setup tunneling](/documentation/guides/tunneling-platform) if you want to receive webhooks from external services.

## Deployment

We provide an official Trigger.dev docker image you can use to easily self-host on your preferred platform. We will provide more extensive guides for each platform in the future.

### Fly.io

There are detailed instructions for [deploying to Fly.io](https://github.com/triggerdotdev/fly.io).
