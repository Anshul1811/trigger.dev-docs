Jobs are the core of the system. They allow you to run code when some event occurs. It might be worth first reading about [Jobs](/documentation/concepts/jobs), [Runs](/documentation/concepts/runs), [Triggers](/documentation/concepts/triggers/introduction) and [Tasks](/documentation/concepts/tasks).

If you'd like to view a load of example Jobs you can [view the examples](/examples).

### 1. Make sure your Project is setup

You need to setup your Project first, we recommend [using the CLI](/documentation/quickstart) to do this.

### 2. Setup Integrations

If you want to use Integrations (to subscribe to webhooks or easily perform a Task with an API) you will need to [connect them](/documentation/guides/using-integrations).

### 3. Choose a Trigger

Triggers are what cause a Job to run.

Select a Trigger

- [Scheduled](/documentation/concepts/triggers/scheduled)
- [Webhook](/documentation/concepts/triggers/webhooks)
- [Event](/documentation/concepts/triggers/events)
- [Dynamic](/documentation/concepts/triggers/dynamic)

### 4. Write your Job code

The body of your Job code can use a combination of regular code and [Tasks](/documentation/concepts/tasks).

### 5. Test your Job

You can [start a test Run from the dashboard](/documentation/guides/testing-jobs).
