You are developing locally and need to connect to Trigger.dev (cloud or self-hosted on the internet).

## How do I do it?

There are a few ways to do this, but we recommend using [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/). It's free and easy to use.

### 1. Download and setup ngrok

You can download ngrok [here](https://ngrok.com/download).

Follow the instructions on that page, but instead of port 80 use port 3000 (or wherever your Next.js app is running).

This will give you a public URL that you can then use for the `VERCEL_URL` environment variable.

### 2. Use the public URL

Use the public URL that ngrok gave you for the `VERCEL_URL` environment variable.
