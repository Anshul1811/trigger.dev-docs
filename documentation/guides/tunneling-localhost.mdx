You are developing locally and need to connect to Trigger.dev (cloud or self-hosted on the internet).

## How do I do it?

There are a few ways to do this, but we recommend using [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/). It's free and easy to use.

### Start ngrok

<Snippet file="ngrok-steps.mdx" />

### Use the forwarding URL

Use the forwarding URL that ngrok gave you for the `VERCEL_URL` environment variable.
