If you're setting up your project for the first time, we recommend using the CLI by following the [Quickstart guide](/documentation/quickstart).

The CLI makes it easy to set up and run your project on Trigger.dev. It's separated into 2 commands:

1. The `init` command incorporates Trigger.dev into your Next.js project. It performs the following functions:

- Adds Trigger.dev to the project.
- Creates a new route.
- Generates an example file.

  During execution, this command requires some configuration parameters. Detailed information on these parameters can be found in the next section. It's important to note that the `init` command is typically executed only once per project.

2. The `dev` command. Once you're running your Next.js project locally, you can then execute the `dev` CLI command to run Trigger.dev locally. You should run this command every time you want to use Trigger.dev locally.
