## 1. Create an integration client

```ts
//1. Import the integration packages you want to use
import { Github } from "@trigger.dev/github";
import { OpenAI } from "@trigger.dev/openai";

//2. Create a new instance of the integration client
// GitHub uses personal access tokens so the param is called `token`
const github = new Github({
  id: "github",
  token: process.env.GITHUB_TOKEN,
});

// OpenAI uses API keys so the param is called `apiKey`
const openai = new OpenAI({
  id: "openai",
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
});
```

Note that we used `process.env.GITHUB_TOKEN` and `process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY`. They're environment variables, which are a way of not putting secret values directly in your code.

For Next.js, local environment variables usually live in a `.env.local` file in the root of the project.
