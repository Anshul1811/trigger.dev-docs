## Install the packages

The basic packages needed are the SDK and the Next.js package.

```bash
npm install @trigger.dev/sdk@next @trigger.dev/nextjs
```

You'll also need to install any integrations you're going to work with

```bash
npm install @trigger.dev/github@next
```

## Setup your Client and API route

The `Client` is used to run and register Jobs. The API route is how messages are received from the Trigger.dev service.

The setup is slightly different depending if you're using the Next.js `pages` directory or `app` directory.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="App directory">
If your routes are in the `app` directory, do the following:

Create a file called in your app folder called `api/trigger.route.ts`

```typescript app/api/trigger/route.ts
import { Job, TriggerClient } from "@trigger.dev/sdk";
import { createAppRoute } from "@trigger.dev/nextjs";

//create the client
export const client = new TriggerClient({
  id: "nextjs-appdir",
  url: process.env.VERCEL_URL,
  apiKey: process.env.TRIGGER_API_KEY,
  apiUrl: process.env.TRIGGER_API_URL,
  logLevel: "debug",
});

//create the app route, pointing at this path
export const { POST, dynamic } = createAppRoute(client, {
  path: "/api/trigger",
});
```

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Pages directory">

If your routes are in the `pages` directory, do this:

Create a file in your pages directory called `api/trigger.ts`

```typescript pages/api/trigger.ts
import { Job, TriggerClient } from "@trigger.dev/sdk";
import { createPagesRoute } from "@trigger.dev/nextjs";

//create the client
export const client = new TriggerClient({
  id: "nextjs-appdir",
  url: process.env.VERCEL_URL,
  apiKey: process.env.TRIGGER_API_KEY,
  apiUrl: process.env.TRIGGER_API_URL,
  logLevel: "debug",
});

//create the pages route, pointing at this path
const { handler, config } = createPagesRoute(client, { path: "/api/trigger" });
export { config };
export default handler;
```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Add environment variables

You will need a Trigger.dev API key, which you can get by logging in to the Trigger.dev platform and going to the "Environments & API Keys" page.

Create a `.env.local` file if it doesn't exist. Add the following variables to it:

```bash .env.local
# Replace the below with your Trigger.dev Dev API key
TRIGGER_API_KEY=tr_dev_abcdefghijkl

# Replace the below with the local URL of your Next.js app
VERCEL_URL=http://localhost:3000

# You only need the API URL if you're self-hosting the Trigger.dev platform
# TRIGGER_API_URL=http://localhost:3000
```
