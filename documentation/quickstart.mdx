## Getting an API key

Login to the Trigger.dev platform and go to the "Environments & API Keys" page in your project. Copy the `dev` API key.

## Run your Next.js site

Make sure your Next.js site is running locally, we will connect to it to register your Jobs.

## Use the CLI

The easiest way to get started it to use the CLI. It will add Trigger.dev to your existing Next.js project, setup a route and give you an example file.

In a new terminal (so you're running the Next.js site at the same time):

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npx @trigger.dev/init
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm dlx @trigger.dev/init
```

```bash yarn
yarn @trigger.dev/init
```

</CodeGroup>

## Your first job

The CLI created a simple Job for you. There will be a new file either `api/trigger/route.ts` or `pages/api/trigger.ts`.

In there is this Job:

```typescript
new Job(client, {
  id: "example-job",
  name: "Example Job",
  version: "0.0.1",
  trigger: eventTrigger({
    name: "example.event",
  }),
  run: async (payload, io, ctx) => {
    await io.logger.info("Hello world!", { payload });

    return {
      message: "Hello world!",
    };
  },
});
```

If you login to your Trigger.dev project you will see this Job in the "Jobs" section:

![Your first Job](/images/first-job.png)

## Triggering the Job

There are two way to trigger this Job.

1. Use the "Test" functionality in the dashboard.
2. Use the Trigger.dev API (either via our SDK or a web request)

### Using the dashboard

Click into the Job and then open the "Test" tab. You should see this page:

![Test Job](/images/test-job.png)

This Job doesn't have a payload schema (meaning it takes an empty object), so you can simple click the "Run test" button.

Congratulations, you should get redirected so you can see your first Run!

### Using the SDK

You can also send an event programmatically using the `client.sendEvent` function.

```typescript
const result = await client.sendEvent({ name: "example.event", payload: {} });
```

The most likely scenario is that you will use this to send events from your api routes when user's interact with your app.
