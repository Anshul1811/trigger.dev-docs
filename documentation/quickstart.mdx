## Getting an API key

Login to the Trigger.dev platform and go to the "Environments & API Keys" page in your project. Copy the `dev` API key.

## Run your Next.js site

Make sure your Next.js site is running locally, we will connect to it to register your Jobs.

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm run dev
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm run dev
```

```bash yarn
yarn run dev
```

</CodeGroup>

<Note>

You must leave this running for the rest of the steps.

</Note>

## Setup tunneling

You'll need to use a reverse tunneling service to expose your local Next.js dev server to the internet. This allows Trigger.dev to make HTTP requests to your local machine. We recommend using [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/):

<Snippet file="ngrok-steps.mdx" />

## Use the CLI

The easiest way to get started it to use the CLI. It will add Trigger.dev to your existing Next.js project, setup a route and give you an example file.

In a new terminal (so you're running the Next.js site at the same time):

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npx @trigger.dev/init@latest
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm dlx @trigger.dev/init@latest
```

```bash yarn
yarn @trigger.dev/init@latest
```

</CodeGroup>

It will ask you a few questions

1. Are you using the Trigger.dev cloud or self-hosted? You're probably using the cloud.
2. Enter your development API key. Enter the key you copied earlier
3. What's the URL of your Next.js project? Use the ngrok forwarding URL you just copied

## Your first job

The CLI created a simple Job for you. There will be a new file either `api/trigger/route.ts` or `pages/api/trigger.ts`.

In there is this Job:

```typescript
new Job(client, {
  id: "example-job",
  name: "Example Job",
  version: "0.0.1",
  trigger: eventTrigger({
    name: "example.event",
  }),
  run: async (payload, io, ctx) => {
    await io.logger.info("Hello world!", { payload });

    return {
      message: "Hello world!",
    };
  },
});
```

If you login to your Trigger.dev project you will see this Job in the "Jobs" section:

![Your first Job](/images/first-job.png)

## Triggering the Job

There are two way to trigger this Job.

1. Use the "Test" functionality in the dashboard.
2. Use the Trigger.dev API (either via our SDK or a web request)

### Using the dashboard

Click into the Job and then open the "Test" tab. You should see this page:

![Test Job](/images/test-job.png)

This Job doesn't have a payload schema (meaning it takes an empty object), so you can simple click the "Run test" button.

Congratulations, you should get redirected so you can see your first Run!

### Using the SDK

You can also send an event programmatically using the `client.sendEvent` function.

```typescript
const result = await client.sendEvent({ name: "example.event", payload: {} });
```

The most likely scenario is that you will use this to send events from your api routes when user's interact with your app.
