## Use the CLI

The basic packages needed are the SDK and the Next.js package.

```bash
npm install @trigger.dev/sdk@next @trigger.dev/nextjs
```

You'll also need to install any integrations you're going to work with

```bash
npm install @trigger.dev/github@next
```

## Setup your Client and API route

The `Client` is used to run and register Jobs. The API route is how messages are received from the Trigger.dev service.

The setup is slightly different depending if you're using the Next.js `pages` directory or `app` directory.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="App directory">
If your routes are in the `app` directory, do the following:

Create a file called in your app folder called `api/trigger.route.ts`

```typescript app/api/trigger/route.ts
import { Job, TriggerClient } from "@trigger.dev/sdk";
import { createAppRoute } from "@trigger.dev/nextjs";

//create the client
export const client = new TriggerClient({
  id: "nextjs-appdir",
  url: process.env.VERCEL_URL,
  apiKey: process.env.TRIGGER_API_KEY,
  apiUrl: process.env.TRIGGER_API_URL,
  logLevel: "debug",
});

//create the app route, pointing at this path
export const { POST, dynamic } = createAppRoute(client, {
  path: "/api/trigger",
});
```

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Pages directory">

If your routes are in the `pages` directory, do this:

Create a file in your pages directory called `api/trigger.ts`

```typescript pages/api/trigger.ts
import { Job, TriggerClient } from "@trigger.dev/sdk";
import { createPagesRoute } from "@trigger.dev/nextjs";

//create the client
export const client = new TriggerClient({
  id: "nextjs-appdir",
  url: process.env.VERCEL_URL,
  apiKey: process.env.TRIGGER_API_KEY,
  apiUrl: process.env.TRIGGER_API_URL,
  logLevel: "debug",
});

//create the pages route, pointing at this path
const { handler, config } = createPagesRoute(client, { path: "/api/trigger" });
export { config };
export default handler;
```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Add environment variables

You will need a Trigger.dev API key, which you can get by logging in to the Trigger.dev platform and going to the "Environments & API Keys" page.

Create a `.env.local` file if it doesn't exist. Add the following variables to it:

```bash .env.local
# Replace the below with your Trigger.dev Dev API key
TRIGGER_API_KEY=tr_dev_abcdefghijkl

# Replace the below with the local URL of your Next.js app
VERCEL_URL=http://localhost:3000

# You only need the API URL if you're self-hosting the Trigger.dev platform
# TRIGGER_API_URL=http://localhost:3010
```

## Creating your first job

We're going to create a simple Job that listens for GitHub issues being opened and logs.

Install the GitHub integration package:

```bash
npm install @trigger.dev/github@next
```

For now we'll add the Job to the same file as your route.

<Note>
  When you move your Jobs to another file you need to import them somewhere that
  is run. We recommended importing them at the top of your route file that we
  created above by doing `import "@/jobs/myjob.ts`
</Note>

```typescript the file you created above
//add this to the top
import { Github, events } from "@trigger.dev/github";

//add this to the bottom

//create GitHub client
const github = new Github({
  id: "github",
  //todo you will need to add GITHUB_TOKEN to your .env.local file with a valid GitHub token
  token: process.env.GITHUB_TOKEN,
});

//your first job, subscribes to GitHub issues opened
new Job(client, {
  id: "alert-on-new-github-issues",
  name: "Alert on new GitHub issues",
  version: "0.1.0",
  trigger: github.triggers.repo({
    event: events.onIssueOpened,
    owner: "triggerdotdev",
    repo: "empty",
  }),
  run: async (payload, io, ctx) => {
    await io.wait("wait", 5); // wait for 5 seconds
    await io.logger.info("This is a simple log info message");
  },
});
```
