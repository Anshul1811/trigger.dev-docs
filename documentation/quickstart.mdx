## Getting an API key

Login to the Trigger.dev platform and go to the "Environments & API Keys" page in your project. Copy the `dev` API key.

## Use the CLI

The easiest way to get started it to use the CLI. It will add Trigger.dev to your existing Next.js project, setup a route and give you an example file.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Trigger.dev self-hosted">
This assumes that you are running Trigger.dev on your machine on port 3010 using Docker and your Next.js app is on port 3000.

```bash
npx @trigger.dev/init -t http://localhost:3010 -u http://host.docker.internal:3000
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="Trigger.dev Cloud">

This is coming soon.

```bash
npx @trigger.dev/init
```

</Tab>

## Your first job

The CLI created a simple Job for you. There will be a new file either `api/trigger/route.ts` or `pages/api/trigger.ts`.

In there is this Job:

```typescript
new Job(client, {
  id: "example-job",
  name: "Example Job",
  version: "0.0.1",
  trigger: eventTrigger({
    name: "example.event",
  }),
  run: async (payload, io, ctx) => {
    await io.logger.info("Hello world!", { payload });

    return {
      message: "Hello world!",
    };
  },
});
```

If you login to your Trigger.dev project you will see the Job in the "Jobs" section.

## Triggering the Job

You can Trigger the Job using the Test
