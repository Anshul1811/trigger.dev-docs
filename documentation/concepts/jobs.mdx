> A Job defines what event triggers it and what should happen when it is run.

For example, you can create a Job that will send an email to a user when they sign up for your app.

### Anatomy of a job

A Job is made up of a few things:

1. Metadata
2. A Trigger (what event should cause this job to run)
3. The Run function (what should happen when this job runs)

```ts
//Job definition â€“ uses the client
new Job(client, {
  // 1. Metadata
  id: "event-1",
  name: "Run when the foo.bar event happens",
  version: "0.0.1",
  // 2. Trigger
  trigger: eventTrigger({
    name: "foo.bar",
  }),
  // 3. Run function
  run: async (payload, io, ctx) => {
    // do something
  },
});
```
