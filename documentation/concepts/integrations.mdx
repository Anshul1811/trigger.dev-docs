An integration is a package you install that makes it easy to work with a specific API.

Integrations can:

- Create a connection to the API (using OAuth, API keys or tokens)
- Provide a set of [Tasks](/documentation/concepts/tasks) to work with the API
- Provide a set of [Triggers](/documentation/concepts/triggers) to listen for events from the API
- Allow you to use the **full underlying authenticated SDK client** directly

## An example

This job sends Slack messages when a new GitHub issue is opened on the `triggerdotdev/trigger.dev` repo.

```ts
import { Github } from "@trigger.dev/github";
import { Slack } from "@trigger.dev/slack";

//1. create GitHub client using a token
const github = new Github({
  id: "github",
  token: process.env.GITHUB_TOKEN,
});

//2. create Slack client using OAuth
const slack = new Slack({
  id: "slack",
});

new Job(client, {
  id: "alert-on-new-github-issues",
  name: "Alert on new GitHub issues",
  version: "0.1.1",
  integrations: {
    //3. include the slack integration
    slack,
  },
  //4. use the github integration to listen for new issues
  trigger: github.triggers.repo({
    event: events.onIssueOpened,
    owner: "triggerdotdev",
    repo: "trigger.dev",
  }),
  run: async (payload, io, ctx) => {
    //5. send a message to slack
    const response = await io.slack.postMessage("Slack alert", {
      text: `New Issue opened: ${payload.issue.html_url}`,
      channel: "C04GWBTDQ7W",
    });

    return response;
  },
});
```

There are some things worth highlighting here:

1. Integration clients can use API keys or tokens.
2. Integration clients can use OAuth.
3. Integrations are added to a Job by adding them to the `integrations`.
4. The Job Trigger can use an integration to listen for events from the API.
5. You can use the integration to make API calls inside the `run` function.

## Authentication

### API Keys and Tokens

You the value in when creating your Integration client. They are never sent from your server by the Trigger.dev service, they are local to your servers. We recommend you use a secure method of storing these values and passing them to your code, like environment variables.

### OAuth

You can use the [Integrations GUI](documentation/guides/integrations) to setup OAuth for an integration. We make it easy to use OAuth by dealing with the OAuth flow, token refreshing and storage for you.

You can use OAuth to authenticate your internal team with an integration or to allow your users to authenticate with an integration â€“ we call user authentication [Trigger.dev Connect](/documentation/guides/connect).
