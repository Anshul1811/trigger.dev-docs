A [TriggerClient](/documentation/concepts/client-adaptors) is used to connect to a specific [Project](/documentation/concepts/projects) by using an [API Key](/documentation/concepts/environments-apikeys).

```ts Example
export const client = new TriggerClient({
  id: "my-webapp",
  apiKey: process.env.TRIGGER_API_KEY,
  logLevel: "debug",
});
```

## Constructor

#### [TriggerClient()](/sdk/triggerclient/constructor)

Creates a new TriggerClient object.

## Instance properties

<ResponseField name="id" type="string">
  Is used to uniquely identify the client.
</ResponseField>

## Instance methods

#### [attach()](/sdk/triggerclient/instancemethods/attach)

Attaches the passed in `Job` to the `TriggerClient`. This happens automatically on Job creation, so you shouldn't need to call this method yourself.
