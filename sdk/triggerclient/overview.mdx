A [TriggerClient](/documentation/concepts/client-adaptors) is used to connect to a specific [Project](/documentation/concepts/projects) by using an [API Key](/documentation/concepts/environments-apikeys).

```ts Example
export const client = new TriggerClient({
  id: "my-webapp",
  apiKey: process.env.TRIGGER_API_KEY,
  logLevel: "debug",
});
```

## Constructor

### [TriggerClient()](/sdk/triggerclient/constructor)

Creates a new TriggerClient object.

## Instance properties

<ResponseField name="id" type="string">
  Is used to uniquely identify the client.
</ResponseField>

## Instance methods

#### [attachJobToDynamicTrigger()](/sdk/triggerclient/instancemethods/attachjobtodynamictrigger)

Attaches the passed in `Job` and `DynamicTrigger` to the `TriggerClient`. This happens automatically when a `Job` is created, so you shouldn't need to call this method yourself.

### Internal methods

#### attach()

This happens automatically on Job creation, so you shouldn't need to call this method directly yourself. It attaches the passed in `Job` to the `TriggerClient`.

//todo mark these and don't have pages on them, as they're not meant to be used

#### attachDynamicTrigger()

This happens automatically when creating a `DynamicTrigger`, so you shouldn't need to call this method directly yourself. It attaches the passed in `DynamicTrigger` to the `TriggerClient`.

#### attachJobToDynamicTrigger()

This happens automatically when a `Job` is created, so you shouldn't need to call this method directly yourself. It attaches the passed in `Job` and `DynamicTrigger` to the `TriggerClient`.

#### attachSource()

This happens automatically when a Job with an `ExternalSource` is created, so you shouldn't need to call this method directly yourself. It attaches the passed in `ExternalSource` to the `TriggerClient`.

#### attachDynamicSchedule()

This happens automatically when a `Job` with a `DynamicSchedule` Trigger is created, so you shouldn't need to call this method directly yourself. It attaches the passed in `DynamicSchedule` to the `TriggerClient`.

#### registerTrigger()

This happens automatically when `register()` is called on a `DynamicTrigger`, so you shouldn't need to call this method directly yourself.

#### getAuth()

This happens automatically when a `Job` starts, so you shouldn't need to call this medthod directly yourself. If the connection is OAuth it fetches the latest accessToken from the API.
