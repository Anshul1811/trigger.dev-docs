sidebarTitle: "sendEvent()"
description: "The `sendEvent()` instance method send an event that triggers any Jobs that are listening for that event (based on the name)."
---

You can call this function from anywhere in your code to send an event. The other way to send an event is by using `io.sendEvent()` from inside a `run()` function.

Use `eventTrigger()` on a Job to listen for events.

# Parameters

<ParamField body="event" type="object" required>
  <Expandable title="properties" defaultOpen>
    <ParamField body="name" type="string" required>
      The `name` property must exactly match any subscriptions you want to
      trigger.
    </ParamField>
    <ParamField body="payload" type="any">
      The `payload` property will be sent to any matching Jobs and will appear
      as the `payload` param of the `run()` function. You can leave this
      parameter out if you just want to trigger a Job without any input data.
    </ParamField>
    <ParamField body="context" type="any">
      The optional `context` property will be sent to any matching Jobs and will
      be passed through as the `context.event.context` param of the `run()`
      function. This is optional but can be useful if you want to pass through
      some additional context to the Job.
    </ParamField>
    <ParamField body="id" type="string">
      The `id` property uniquely identify this particular event. If unset it
      will be set automatically using `ulid`.
    </ParamField>
    <ParamField body="timestamp" type="string">
      This is optional, it defaults to the current timestamp. Usually you would
      only set this if you have a timestamp that you wish to pass through, e.g.
      you receive a timestamp from a service and you want the same timestamp to
      be used in your Job.
    </ParamField>
    <ParamField body="source" type="string">
      This is optional, it defaults to "trigger.dev". It can be useful to set
      this as you can filter events using this in the `eventTrigger()`.
    </ParamField>
  </Expandable>
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="options" type="object">
  <Expandable title="properties" defaultOpen>
    <ParamField body="deliverAt" type="Date">
      An optional Date when you want the event to Trigger Jobs. The event will
      be sent to the platform immediately but won't be acted upon until the
      specified time.
    </ParamField>
    <ParamField body="deliverAfter" type="number">
      An optional number of seconds you want to wait for the event to Trigger
      any relevant Jobs. The event will be sent to the platform immediately but
      won't be acted upon until the specified time.
    </ParamField>
    <ParamField body="accountId" type="string">
      This optional param will be used by the Trigger.dev Connect feature, which
      is coming soon.
    </ParamField>
  </Expandable>
</ParamField>
