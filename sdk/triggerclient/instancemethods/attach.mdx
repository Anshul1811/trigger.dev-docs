This happens automatically on [Job](/sdk/job) creation, so you shouldn't need to call this method yourself.

# Parameters

<ParamField body="options" type="Job" required>
  A [Job](/sdk/job) instance to attach to the `TriggerClient`.
</ParamField>

# Returns

<ResponseField name="void" type="void" />
