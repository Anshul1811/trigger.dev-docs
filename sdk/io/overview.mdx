### Instance methods

### [wait()](/sdk/io/wait)

Waits for a certain amount of time before continuing the Job. Delays works even if you're on a serverless platform with timeouts, or if your server goes down. They utilize [resumability](/documentation/concepts/resumability) to ensure that the Run can be resumed after the delay.

### [sendEvent()](/sdk/io/sendevent)

`io.sendEvent()` allows you to send an event from inside a Job run. The sent even will trigger any Jobs that are listening for that event (based on the name).

If you want to send an event from outside a run (e.g. just from your backend) you can use [client.sendEvent()](/sdk/triggerclient/instancemethods/sendevent).

## Properties

<ResponseField name="logger" type="IOLogger">
  Used to send log messages to the [Run log](/documentation/guides/viewing-runs).

There are 5 levels:
`io.logger.log()` - logs only essential messages
`io.logger.error()` - logs error messages
`io.logger.warn()` - logs errors and warning messages
`io.logger.info()` - logs errors, warnings and info messages
`io.logger.debug()` - logs everything with full verbosity

```ts
await io.logger.error("This is a log error message", {
  payload,
});
```

You pass a message and an optional object with additional data to log.

Please note that if you set the `logLevel` on the Job or Client so only messages of a certain level are logged, then the `io.logger` will only log messages of that level or higher.
