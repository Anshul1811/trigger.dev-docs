### Instance methods

### [wait()](/sdk/io/wait)

Waits for a certain amount of time before continuing the Job. Delays works even if you're on a serverless platform with timeouts, or if your server goes down. They utilize [resumability](/documentation/concepts/resumability) to ensure that the Run can be resumed after the delay.

### [sendEvent()](/sdk/io/sendevent)

`io.sendEvent()` allows you to send an event from inside a Job run. The sent even will trigger any Jobs that are listening for that event (based on the name).

If you want to send an event from outside a run (e.g. just from your backend) you can use [client.sendEvent()](/sdk/triggerclient/instancemethods/sendevent).

### [backgroundFetch()](/sdk/io/backgroundfetch)

`io.backgroundFetch()` allows you to fetch data from a URL that can take longer that the serverless timeout. The actual `fetch` request is performed on the Trigger.dev platform, and the response is sent back to you. An example use case is fetching data from a slow API, like some AI endpoints.

### [registerInterval()](/sdk/io/registerinterval)

`io.registerInterval()` allows you to register a [DynamicSchedule](/sdk/dynamic-schedule) that will run on a regular interval.
