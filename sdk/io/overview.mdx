## Integrations

Any integrations that you added in the `integrations` param of the [Job constructor](/sdk/job) will be available on the `io` object in the `run()` function with the same name as the key. For example:

<Accordion title="How to pass in integrations">
  <Snippet file="how-to-pass-integrations.mdx" />
</Accordion>

View [the integrations documentation](/integrations) for information on how to use integrations.

## Properties

### [logger](/sdk/io/logger)

Used to send log messages to the [Run log](/documentation/guides/viewing-runs).

## Instance methods

### [wait()](/sdk/io/wait)

Waits for a certain amount of time before continuing the Job. Delays works even if you're on a serverless platform with timeouts, or if your server goes down. They utilize [resumability](/documentation/concepts/resumability) to ensure that the Run can be resumed after the delay.

### [sendEvent()](/sdk/io/sendevent)

`io.sendEvent()` allows you to send an event from inside a Job run. The sent even will trigger any Jobs that are listening for that event (based on the name).

If you want to send an event from outside a run (e.g. just from your backend) you can use [client.sendEvent()](/sdk/triggerclient/instancemethods/sendevent).

### [backgroundFetch()](/sdk/io/backgroundfetch)

`io.backgroundFetch()` allows you to fetch data from a URL that can take longer that the serverless timeout. The actual `fetch` request is performed on the Trigger.dev platform, and the response is sent back to you. An example use case is fetching data from a slow API, like some AI endpoints.

### [registerInterval()](/sdk/io/registerinterval)

`io.registerInterval()` allows you to register a [DynamicSchedule](/sdk/dynamicschedule) that will run on a regular interval.

### [unregisterInterval()](/sdk/io/unregisterinterval)

`io.unregisterInterval()` allows you to unregister a [DynamicSchedule](/sdk/dynamicschedule) that was previously registered with `io.registerInterval()`.

### [registerCron()](/sdk/io/registercron)

`io.registerCron()` allows you to register a [DynamicSchedule](/sdk/dynamicschedule) that will run on a regular cron schedule.

### [unregisterCron()](/sdk/io/unregistercron)

`io.unregisterCron()` allows you to unregister a [DynamicSchedule](/sdk/dynamicschedule) that was previously registered with `io.registerCron()`.
