description: "Job is used to create and configure a Job"

A [Job](/documentation/concepts/jobs) is used to define the [Trigger](/documentation/concepts/triggers), metadata, and what happens when it runs.

By far the most important thing to understand is the constructor.

# Constructor

<RequestExample>

```ts cronTrigger
new Job(client, {
  id: "slack-kpi-summary",
  name: "Slack kpi summary",
  version: "0.1.1",
  integrations: {
    slack,
  },
  trigger: cronTrigger({
    cron: "0 9 * * *", // 9am every day (UTC)
  }),
  run: async (payload, io, ctx) => {
    const { revenue } = await db.getKpiSummary(payload.ts);
    const response = await io.slack.postMessage("Slack 📝", {
      text: `Yesterday's revenue was $${revenue}`,
      channel: "C04GWUTDC3W",
    });

    return response;
  },
});
```

```ts webhook
new Job(client, {
  id: "github-integration-on-issue",
  name: "GitHub Integration - On Issue",
  version: "0.1.0",
  trigger: github.triggers.repo({
    event: events.onIssue,
    owner: "triggerdotdev",
    repo: "empty",
  }),
  run: async (payload, io, ctx) => {
    await io.logger.info("This is a simple log info message");
    return { payload, ctx };
  },
});
```

```ts event
new Job(client, {
  id: "openai-joke",
  name: "OpenAI Joke",
  version: "0.0.1",
  trigger: eventTrigger({
    name: "openai.joke",
    schema: z.object({
      jokePrompt: z.string(),
    }),
  }),
  integrations: {
    openai,
  },
  run: async (payload, io, ctx) => {
    const joke = await io.openai.backgroundCreateChatCompletion(
      "generate-jokes",
      {
        model: "gpt-3.5-turbo",
        messages: [
          {
            role: "user",
            content: payload.jokePrompt,
          },
        ],
      }
    );

    return joke.choices;
  },
});
```

</RequestExample>

## Parameters

<ParamField body="client" type="object" required>
  An instance of [TriggerClient](/sdk/triggerclient) that is used to send events
  to the Trigger API.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="options" type="object" required>
  <Expandable title="properties" defaultOpen>
    <ParamField body="id" type="string" required>
      The `id` property is used to uniquely identify the Job. Only change this if you want to create a new Job.
    </ParamField>
    <ParamField body="name" type="string" required>
      The `name` of the Job that you want to appear in the dashboard and logs. You can change this without creating a new Job.
    </ParamField>
    <ParamField body="version" type="string" required>
      The `version` property is used to version your Job. A new version will be created if you change this property. We recommend using [semantic versioning](https://www.baeldung.com/cs/semantic-versioning), e.g. `1.0.3`.
    </ParamField>
    <ParamField body="enabled" type="boolean">
      If set to `false`, the Job will not run. Defaults to `true`.
    </ParamField>
    <ParamField body="integrations" type="object">
      Imports the specified integrations into the Job. The integrations will be available on the `io` object in the `run()` function with the same name as the key. For example:
      ```ts
      new Job(client, {
        //... other options
        integrations: {
          slack,
          gh: github,
        },
        run: async (payload, io, ctx) => {
          //slack is available on io.slack
          io.slack.postMessage(...);
          //github is available on io.gh
          io.gh.addIssueLabels(...);
        }
      });
      ```
    </ParamField>
    <ParamField body="trigger" type="object" required>
      The `trigger` property is used to define when the Job should run. There are currently the following Trigger types:
      - [cronTrigger](/sdk/crontrigger)
      - [intervalTrigger](/sdk/intervaltrigger)
      - [eventTrigger](/sdk/eventtrigger)
      - [DynamicTrigger](/sdk/dynamictrigger)
      - [DynamicSchedule](/sdk/dynamicschedule)
      - integration Triggers, like webhooks. See the [integrations](/integrations) page for more information.
    </ParamField>

  </Expandable>
</ParamField>

## Returns

<ResponseField name="TriggerClient instance" type="TriggerClient" />

## Constructor

### [Job()](/sdk/job/constructor)

Creates a new Job object.

## Instance properties

<ResponseField name="id" type="string">
  Is used to uniquely identify the client.
</ResponseField>

## Instance methods

#### [sendEvent()](/sdk/triggerclient/instancemethods/sendevent)

Sending an event triggers any Jobs that are listening for that event (based on the name). Use [eventTrigger()](/sdk/eventtrigger) on a Job to listen for events.

You can call this function from anywhere in your code to send an event. The other way to send an event is by using [io.sendEvent()](/sdk/io) from inside a `run()` function.
