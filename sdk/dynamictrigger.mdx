### Example use cases:

#### Subscribe to new GitHub issues for all your repos

1. Create a `DynamicTrigger` with the [onIssueOpened](/integrations/apis/github-triggers) event.
2. Loop through all of your repos add them to it.
3. Use an [onNewRepository](/integrations/apis/github-triggers) trigger and add them to the `DynamicTrigger`.

<RequestExample>

```typescript DynamicTrigger
//1. create a DynamicTrigger
const dynamicOnIssueOpenedTrigger = new DynamicTrigger(client, {
  id: "github-issue-opened",
  event: events.onIssueOpened,
  source: github.sources.repo,
});

//2. create a Job that is attached to the dynamic trigger
new Job(client, {
  id: "listen-for-dynamic-trigger",
  name: "Listen for dynamic trigger",
  version: "0.1.1",
  trigger: dynamicOnIssueOpenedTrigger,
  integrations: {
    slack,
  },
  run: async (payload, io, ctx) => {
    await io.slack.postMessage("Slack 📝", {
      text: `New Issue opened on repo: ${
        payload.issue.html_url
      }. \n\n${JSON.stringify(ctx)}`,
      channel: "C04GWUTDC3W",
    });
  },
});

//3. Register the DynamicTrigger anywhere in your app
async function registerRepo(owner: string, repo: string) {
  //the first param (key) should be unique
  await dynamicOnIssueOpenedTrigger.register(`${owner}/${repo}`, {
    owner,
    repo,
  });
}

//4. Register inside other Jobs
new Job(client, {
  id: "new-repo",
  name: "New repo",
  version: "0.1.1",
  //5. when a new repo is created in your org
  trigger: github.triggers.org({
    event: events.onNewRepository,
    org: "triggerdotdev",
  }),
  run: async (payload, io, ctx) => {
    //6. Register the dynamic trigger so you get notified when an issue is opened
    return await io.registerTrigger(
      "register-repo",
      dynamicOnIssueOpenedTrigger,
      payload.repository.name,
      {
        owner: payload.repository.owner.login,
        repo: payload.repository.name,
      }
    );
  },
});
```
